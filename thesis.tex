\noindent KEYWORDS: \hspace*{0.5em} \parbox[t]{4.4in}{Hate Speech Spreader; Author Profiling; Twitter}

\vspace*{24pt}

\noindent With the internet becoming more accessible to a larger set of population and the anonymity and freedom provided by social media platforms, hate speech propagation has reached new heights in recent times. With evolving scenario, manually inspecting each post is infeasible. Hence developing automatic hate speech detection systems has been a critical area of research in NLP. The present work focuses on detecting users keen to spread hate rather than classifying individual tweets. Our baselines with Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine achieve an accuracy of 69\% on the test set. While it is intuitive that tweets indicating hate tend to carry a high negative sentiment score, our experiments also show that the negative sentiment score is the most important feature among all other features considered. We plan to work towards incorporating the sentiment scores as weights for denoting the word importance in a tweet and exploring methods thereof.
